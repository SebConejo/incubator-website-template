# Vite + React + Manifest Starter

This project is a starter template using React with Vite for the frontend, and Manifest for the backend.


## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

## 🚀 Getting started

Open **two terminals**:

### Terminal 1 — Frontend

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This starts the React app with Vite.

### Terminal 2 — Manifest Backend 
```bash
cd api
npm i
npm run start
```
This starts the backend generated by Manifest, including a db, a ready-to-use API with its documentation and an admin panel for non-technical users.
