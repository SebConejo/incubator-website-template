# Vite + React + Manifest Starter

This project is a starter template using React with Vite for the frontend, and Manifest for the backend.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

## 🚀 Getting started

Open **two terminals**:

### Terminal 1 — Frontend

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This starts the React app with Vite.

### Terminal 2 — Manifest Backend

```bash
cd api
npm i
npm run start
```

This starts the backend generated by Manifest, including a db, a ready-to-use API with its documentation and an admin panel for non-technical users.

## 📁 Project structure

```java
/
├── api/              → Manifest backend (Just 1-YAML file to define your complete backend)
├── src/              → React frontend
├── public/           → Static assets
├── package.json      → Frontend dependencies and scripts
```

## 🛠 Available scripts

- npm run dev-front: start the frontend
- npm run lint: lint the frontend code
- npm run build: build the frontend for production

## 🌍 Environment configuration

By default, the project runs in **development** mode and expects the Manifest backend to be available locally.

### 1. Create a `.env` file at the root of your frontend project:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1111
```

- This variable tells the React app where to find the API.
- For production, simply change the value:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://produrl.com
```

Or set it in your hosting provider's dashboard to point to your online backend.

**Don't forget to restart your dev server after changing the `.env` file.**
